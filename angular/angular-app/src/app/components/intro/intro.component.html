            <p>Proposed in 1991 by Artur Ekert, E91 protocol is an entanglement-based protocol which uses Bell states

            <br><br>
            <p>The sender (Alice) wants to send quantum information (qubit state |ψ⟩=α|0⟩+β|1⟩) to receiver (Bob). Due
                to
                No-cloning
                theorem Alice cannot simply make an exact copy of an unknown quantum state and give the copy to Bob. We
                can
                only copy
                classical states (not superpositions).To transfer a quantum bit, Alice and Bob must share an entangled
                qubit
                pair. Alice
                then performs a Hadamard operation followed by a CNOT gate between a qubit it wants to send/teleport and
                the
                entangled
                qubit at Alice’s end . And then she measures the qubits out, which is called Bell-state measurement and
                sends the
                measurement results to Bob over a classical communication channel, After Bob receives the message and he
                applies a
                corrective unitary operations (based on the results data that he gets from Alice ) on his entangled part
                of
                the qubit.
                The updated qubit that bob has now is the qubit that was at Alice’s end initially .We call this
                teleportation because,
                at the end , Bob will have |ψ⟩ and Alice won't anymore.</p>
