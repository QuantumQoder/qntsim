        <p>In cryptography, Ciphers are algorithms which describe steps for encrypting and decrypting information.
            Modern
            ciphers
            include the secure transmission of a key which is sent with the plaintext and the encryption algorithm. The
            main
            problem
            of modern cryptographic systems is the distribution among the participants of the communication session of a
            secret
            key,
            possession of which should not be available to third parties. In principle transmitting messages using
            classical
            channels allows an eavesdropper to gain information about the key without being detected. However,
            constructing
            transmission techniques based on quantum mechanics allows parties to transmit messages and detect the
            presence
            of an
            eavesdropper every time. ​
            <br>
            Proposed in 1991 by Artur Ekert, E91 protocol is an entanglement based protocol which uses Bell states
            shared
            between
            Alice and Bob for secure distribution of secret key .
        </p>​
        <ul>
            <li>The sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob) share |ψ-⟩ bell state. Alice makes a measurement with a direction
                randomly
                chosen
                Horizontal (X observable),Diagonal (W observable),Vertical (Z observable). Whereas Bob makes a
                measurement
                with
                a
                direction randomly chosen between Diagonal (W observable),Vertical (Z observable), Anti Diagonal (V
                observable).
                Alice
                and Bob record the measurement results and broadcast the measurement basis which they used, through the
                classical
                channel .If Alice and Bob have measured the spin projections of the entangled pair of qubits onto the
                same
                direction
                (i.e. W--W or Z--Z for Alice's and Bob's qubit respectively), then they are sure that they obtained
                opposite
                results.
                Thus, if Alice got the result ±1, then Bob definitely will get the result ∓1, i.e. the results will be
                perfectly
                anticorrelated. Both Alice and Bob agree on that the measurement +1 represents the classical bit 1,
                while
                the
                measurement –1 represents the classical bit 0, and thus get their key string.​</li>
            <li>Suppose some third party wants to interfere in the communication session of Alice and Bob and obtain a
                secret
                key.
                The
                eavesdropper can use the intercept-resend attacks: Eve intercepts one or both of the entangled qubits,
                measures
                the
                spin
                projections of these qubits, prepares new ones depending on the results obtained (|01⟩ or |10⟩) and
                sends
                them
                to
                Alice
                and Bob.</li>

            <li>Inorder to check presence of eves dropper random part of Secret key generated (test key) is used for eve
                detection .
                If
                the error rate is above threshold value the quantum channel is not safe ( eve is detected) .If its less
                then
                quantum
                channel is safe ( eve not detected) then sifted key can be used as secret key.</li>

        <h1 class="display-1">Teleportation Protocol Introduction</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>The sender (Alice) wants to send quantum information (qubit state |ψ⟩=α|0⟩+β|1⟩) to receiver (Bob). Due to
            No-cloning
            theorem Alice cannot simply make an exact copy of an unknown quantum state and give the copy to Bob. We can
            only copy
            classical states (not superpositions).To transfer a quantum bit, Alice and Bob must share an entangled qubit
            pair. Alice
            then performs a Hadamard operation followed by a CNOT gate between a qubit it wants to send/teleport and the
            entangled
            qubit at Alice’s end . And then she measures the qubits out, which is called Bell-state measurement and
            sends the
            measurement results to Bob over a classical communication channel, After Bob receives the message and he
            applies a
            corrective unitary operations (based on the results data that he gets from Alice ) on his entangled part of
            the qubit.
            The updated qubit that bob has now is the qubit that was at Alice’s end initially .We call this
            teleportation because,
            at the end , Bob will have |ψ⟩ and Alice won't anymore.</p>
